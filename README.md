# aosprotocol
Documentation and development of the protocol 0.80

# What is it. Why should i care or want it or implement it in my client?
For anybody that understands the protocol it surely became obvious that its not great at all.
Full of mistakes that could be handled better, things players need but never gotten and far more.

0.80 is based upon 0.75 but that doesnt mean it will look like it in the future.
The point of this major step is to make the protocol more secure and introduce
features which users would appriciate.

AoS has a small community and it is about time we did something to make the game
more interesting for others so they could get interested in it.

## Workflow
You want to add a packet to AoS? Great!

### Packet Proposal
File an issue and name it `PP: PacketName`. Describe what packet you wish to add,
and how it would improve the game. This will be voted on here on github.
If the community approves that they want this it will be added
(Ofcourse unwanted or duplicated features will be denied)

### Packet Add Request
If your packet has recieved positively it is time to write it up. 
Describe the packet in the style of the other packets and file a Pull Request snd name it `PAR: PacketName`

This started out as a dump of the aoswiki.rakiru.com Protocol page, but is meant to be the hub for
developing the AoS protocol in the future.

Thanks to piqueserver for writting the base of this documentation.
