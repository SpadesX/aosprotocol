# Ace of Spades Protocol
Documentation and development of the protocol 0.80

## Why should i care or want it or implement it in my client?
For anybody that understands the protocol it surely became obvious that its not that great at all.
Full of mistakes that could be handled better, things players need but never gotten and far more.

0.80 is based upon 0.75 but that doesn't mean it will look like it in the future.
The point of this major step is to make the protocol more secure and introduce
features which users would appriciate.

AoS has a small community and it is about time we did something to make the game
more interesting for others so they could get interested in it.
